# FPGA
Following my study I got interested in the Field Programmable Gate Array so I tought of giving it a try here I stored my learning experience on the Makerchip software V5 using .v file and providing at the moment the diagram of the design and the resulting waveform generated I'm looking forward to see where this will bring me. I started with zero knowledge so all of my first code and only that i hope :) will be pretty much messy. I started with TL-Verilog wichi simplyfies the approach to the programming on silicon of the code needed to run the program, at least for the fiorst part I am going to use the Makerchip platform because to my knowledge is the only one supporting TL-Verilog, i will later dive deep i hope also in to the classic VHDL.
