# FPGA
Following my study I got interested in the Field Programmable Gate Array so I tought of giving it a try, here I stored my learning experience on the Makerchip software V5 using .v file and providing  the diagram of the design and the resulting waveform generated I'm looking forward to see where this will bring me. I started with zero knowledge so all of my first code and only that I hope :) will be pretty much messy. I started with TL-Verilog wichi simplyfies the approach to the programming on silicon of the code needed to run the program, at least for the first part I am going to use the Makerchip platform because to my knowledge is the only one supporting TL-Verilog, i will later dive deep also in to the classic VHDL. I also included some exercise that i did on my own to try and understand better the arcane working behind the FPGA and their programming, as stated before there is so much room for improvement and the exercise will maybe become better with time.
